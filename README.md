ðŸ“… Project Progress
âœ… Day 1 â€“ Site Layout + Equipment Placement
Goal: Create a top-down conceptual layout of a municipal booster pump station to visualize the physical location and interaction of key electrical and mechanical components.

ðŸ”§ Tools Used:
AutoCAD 2025

ðŸ“¦ Deliverables:
site_layout.dwg

site_layout.png (exported image)

Legend with color-coded layers

ðŸ§± Components Included:
Electrical Room with MCC, PLC, RTU

2x Booster Pumps (50HP)

2x VFDs (external-mounted)

XFMR-UTIL (utility service transformer)

XFMR-1 (480V â†’ 208Y/120V transformer)

CPT-1 (480V â†’ 120V for controls)

LP-1 (Lighting Panel)

HVAC unit

SCADA Comms block

Inlet and discharge headers with flow arrows

Clearly labeled equipment tags and voltage annotations

ðŸ“Œ Highlights:
Developed spatial understanding of a water treatment electrical setup

Demonstrated understanding of control power separation, power distribution, and SCADA integration

Used layer color coding for power, control, comms, mechanical, process flow, and annotations

âœ… Day 2 â€“ Single-Line Diagram (SLD)
Goal: Show electrical power flow through major components, from utility source to end loads, using symbolic, top-down structure.

ðŸ”§ Tools Used:
AutoCAD 2025

ðŸ“¦ Deliverables:
single_line_diagram.dwg

âš¡ Components Represented:
XFMR-UTIL (12.47kV â†’ 480V)

Main Disconnect (480V, 3-phase)

MCC-1 (480V distribution hub)

Two VFDs feeding two 50HP pumps (P-101, P-102)

XFMR-1 feeding LP-1 for lighting/HVAC

CPT-1 feeding PLC and RTU for controls/SCADA

ðŸ§  Key Concepts Demonstrated:
Correct electrical hierarchy and flow direction (top-down)

Parallel power branches from MCC to all major systems

Use of labels to identify voltage levels and equipment functions

Represented VFD as intermediary between MCC and pumps (no direct MCCâ†’Pump path)

Used clean, symbolic drawing style typical for SLDs
